/**
 * The SimpleInterceptorImpl class is an example of an Interceptor that implements just the Interceptor
 * interface.  See the AllPointsInterceptorSample for an example use of the ServiceProviderInterceptor and
 * EarlyFailureInterceptor interfaces.
 *
 * By implementing the Interceptor interface this Interceptor sample is invoked early when being processed by z/OS
 * Connect EE, and again after the SoR response has been returned and z/OS Connect EE is about to return to the
 * caller. For simplification these points are known as P1, and P4.  See the  AllPointsInterceptorSample for
 * details of points P2 and P3.
 *
 * The flow of the API provider request as it relates to the Interceptor framework is as follows.
 *
 * 1.  A request is received by z/OS Connect EE.
 * 2.  The request is validated, e.g. Bad URL paths, authentication failures, bad JSON, etc.
 * 3.  Next, the requests Service and API information is extracted and matched to registered Services and APIs.
 * 4.  Should the request fail in the above processing the request is said to be an Early Failed request.
 * 5.  If there is an Interceptor registered at the Global level that implements the
 *     EarlyFailureInterceptor interface its earlyFailure method will be invoked and the request terminates.
 * 6.  The API provider request has now passed the early checks, the request can still fail, but it is now
 *     not an early failure and earlyFailure will now not be called.
 * 7.  If there is an Interceptor registered at either the Global, Service or API levels that
 *     implements the Interceptor interface its preInvoke method will be invoked. This is point P1.
 * 8.  Request flow continues through z/OS Connect EE into the Service Provider which will call the
 *     System Of Record, e.g. CICS, IMS, DB2, etc.
 * 9.  If there is an Interceptor registered at either the Global, Service or API levels that
 *     implements the ServiceProviderInterceptor interface its preSorInvoke method will be invoked.
 *     This is point P2.  The SoR is then invoked.
 * 10. Once the SoR returns the ServiceProviderInterceptor is invoked on its postSorInvoke method.
 *     This is point P3.
 * 11. The API provider response flow continues, any registered Interceptors at either the Global, Service or API
 *     levels that implements the Interceptor interface is invoked on its postInvoke method.
 *     This is point P4. Finally the response is sent by z/OS Connect EE.
 *
 * This Interceptor will be notified for all requests entering the z/OS Connect EE application on the Interceptor's
 * preInvoke method at P1 and at postInvoke at P4.
 *
 * This Interceptor also shows an example of how the request can be validated at preInvoke and the request terminated
 * if the validation fails.
